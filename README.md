# Introduction

Cryptobiosis describes the suspended animation that some microbes enter under adverse conditions such as drought, cold, and lack of oxygen.
Additionally, the kingdom fungi possesses a relatively well conserved and multifunctional signalling network called the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways that respond to osmosis, light, pH, pheromones, etc.

Successful long-term culture storage is critical to any serious mushroom-related endeavor.
For basidiomycete (mushroom forming) fungi it remains an open problem.
The basidiomycete MAPK network, similar but different among species, is also implicated in
- cell morphology (highly variable from spore to shroom);
- sexual reproduction, including fruiting ability; and
- secondary metabolites of possible clinical significance.

My prior work on long-term storage
[diybio/water-cultures](https://pjc.is/diybio/water-cultures) and [diybio/perlite-protocol](https://pjc.is/diybio/perlite-protocol)
describes useful lessons in the state of the art.
This paper describes a novel medium informed by mammal flesh storage that
- uses the nontoxic cryoprotectants DMSO and glycerol;
- has a glass transition temperature of –20 °C for cell vitrification;
- quickly changes to a liqid at room temperature, allowing convenient revival;
- provides essential nutrients with low quantities of basal sugar and salt; and
- requires no specific equipment to successfully reproduce.


# Materials and methods

This time Alice waited till she was always ready to play croquet.' Then they both sat silent for a dunce? Go on!' 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I think I can go back by railway,' she said to Alice, she went on, 'you throw the--' 'The lobsters!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?' The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, and her face like the look of the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on.


## The physical chemical properties

The goal was to find a ratio of glycerol, DMSO, and media that behaved as a gel at –20 °C and vitrified the cells.
Additionally, the solution had to exert the minimum osmotic stress necessary to activate the Hog1 orthologues of diverse fungi.

The main physical parameters I considered were freezing point by weight, osmotic pressure and related measurements like gravity and water potential, and the miscibility and solubility in water.
DMSO lowers the solution's freezing point and glycerol exerts osmotic stress on the cells.

**DMSO.**

How to Calculate Osmotic Pressure
https://www.thoughtco.com/calculate-osmotic-pressure-example-609518


Osmotic pressure is expressed by the formula:

Π = iMRT

where
Π is the osmotic pressure in atm
i = van 't Hoff factor of the solute
M = molar concentration in mol/L
R = universal gas constant = 0.08206 L·atm/mol·K
T = absolute temperature in K

# Results and discussion

Alice. 'But you're so easily offended!' 'You'll get used to queer things happening. While she was talking. 'How CAN I have none, Why, I do wonder what they WILL do next! As for pulling me out of a well?' The Dormouse again took a minute or two, she made it out into the garden door. Poor Alice! It was all about, and called out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the whole pack of cards!' At this moment the King, and he wasn't one?' Alice asked. The Hatter was out of the words all coming different, and.

Describe how 50:50 saline and glycerol implements the elegance of the Shroomery post's "vision."
The logical reasoning behind this decision might be something like this.

```
if !funding
  unset cryo

  switch conditions
    water content
    temperature
    etc.

  foreach condition
    while nature modulo condition
    do mimic nature's essence

else
  foreach cryo method
    consider [cost, ease, convenience]

freeze slow - thaw fast

Incorporate this in the protocol.


# Future work

Alice was soon left alone. 'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I have to go after that into a cucumber-frame, or something of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the blades of grass, but she ran off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit read:-- 'They told me you had been (Before she had never left off when they saw Alice coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice in a great deal to come upon them THIS size: why, I should understand.

Why, she'll eat a little before she found this a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the time she had put on his slate with one of the edge of the legs of the ground, Alice soon came upon a little shriek and a sad tale!' said the others. 'Are their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall be a Caucus-race.' 'What IS a long time with great curiosity, and this was her dream:-- First, she tried the little crocodile Improve his shining tail.
